# dddeu22-let-me-be-free-typescript
This Kata is initially made for a Workshop of Domain-Driven Design Europe (DDD Europe) to explain Context Mapping Patterns used in Strategic Design of DDD.
These Patterns are :
- Shared Kernel
- Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)
- Open-Host Service (OHS)
- Separate Ways
- Conformist
- Customer/Supplier

In this Kata we will focus on the first 3 patterns which are Shared Kernel, ACL and OHS.

# Pre-requises
To do this Kata you need following tools :
- Your favorite IDE (mine is IntelliJ Idea)
- node and npm
- Jest installed globally (run this cmd npm install jest --global)
- Git

# How to run this Kata
- Clone this project somewhere in your machine (git clone git@github.com:ksouf/dddeu22-let-me-be-free-typescript.git)
- build the project using Npm (npm install then npm test) : You should obtain PASS with successful tests
- Run tests to ensure that you have green ones

# How to do this Kata
This Kata is splitted in 4 steps (branches step_1, step-2, step-3 and step-4).
Each step contains a solution on a branche named step-x_solution where x is the number of step.
You can read the readme of each step starting with step-0 and you can check the solution branch if needed.
If you don't have time to finish a step in appropriated time, don't worry, you can checkout the next step which contains a possible solution.
